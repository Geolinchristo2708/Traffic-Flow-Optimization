1)Initialize:
Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.
Create a dictionary to store the shortest distances from the start node to each node.
Set the distance to the start node as 0, and infinity for all other nodes.
Create a priority queue (min heap) and add the start node with distance 0.
2)While the priority queue is not empty:
Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
If the node is already visited, skip to the next iteration.
Mark the node as visited.
Update the distances to its neighbors:
For each neighbor of the current node:
Calculate the new distance from the start node to the neighbor through the current node.
If the new distance is shorter than the recorded distance, update the distance.
Add the neighbor and its new distance to the priority queue.
3)Return the distances:
The distances dictionary now contains the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
